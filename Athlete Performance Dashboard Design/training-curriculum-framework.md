3. Map experience level to progression tier
4. Calculate available training volume (days × duration)
5. Flag any injuries/limitations

**Plan Assembly**:
1. Select appropriate macrocycle structure (4/8/12 weeks)
2. Apply periodization model based on experience

3. Evidence-based protocols from current research
4. Scalable across experience levels and time commitments
5. Comprehensive integration of skills, physical development, nutrition, and recovery
6. Measurable outcomes with clear KPIs

**Implementation Priorities**:
1. Build robust exercise library with video content
2. Develop plan generation algorithms
3. Create intuitive user interface for session execution
4. Implement progress tracking and visualization
5. Establish testing protocols and data collection
6. Iterate based on athlete outcomes and feedback

This system positions your athlete dashboard as a comprehensive, elite-level training platform that rivals professional team resources, made accessible to athletes at all levels.
